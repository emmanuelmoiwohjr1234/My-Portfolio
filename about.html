                    his mentorship, I learned the fundamentals of programming languages
                     and coding, which laid a solid foundation for my journey in the world
                      of technology and software development.

                <p>Moreover, I am still in the process of learning and

                     through the course at Zongea Institution of Technology (ZIT).

                      opportunity to expand my understanding and skills.</p>
